# Unraveling the Secrets of Hair Loss 
Hair health is a reflection of internal biological processes and external environmental interactions.
This project endeavors to decode the complexities of hair health by analyzing a myriad of contributing factors, from genetics to lifestyle choices. My aim is to harness the power of data to predict whether someone is bald.

I concentrated on evaluating the effectiveness of models such as:             
***Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees,        
  Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes and Neural Networks***.
